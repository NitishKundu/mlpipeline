# End To End Machine Learning Project

### This project demonstrates how to build an end-to-end machine learning project using a modular programming approach. The project is divided into several modules, each of which performs a specific task. This modular approach makes the project easier to understand, maintain, and extend.

### The project uses the following modules:

* Data loading and preprocessing: This module loads the data from a file and performs basic preprocessing tasks, such as cleaning and formatting the data.
* Feature engineering: This module creates new features from the existing data.
* Model training: This module trains a machine-learning model on the data.
* Model evaluation: This module evaluates the performance of the trained model.
* Model deployment: This module deploys the trained model to a web application.

### The project is implemented in Python and uses the following libraries:

* NumPy: For numerical computing
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
* Scikit-learn: For machine learning
* Flask: For web development

### Project Instructions

To run the project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the project by following these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository.
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install the project dependencies.
Run the app.py file.
The project will be deployed to a local web server. You can access the web application at http://localhost:5000.

#### Project Benefits

The benefits of using a modular programming approach for machine learning projects include:

* Increased code readability and maintainability
* Easier to extend the project with new features
* Improved debugging and testing
* Increased portability of the project
